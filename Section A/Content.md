 This part of the course is to introduce you to the folowing facts
  1. Computers are made up of two major parts(Hardware and Software) Hardware is the physical component, and the software are the programs and set of organised instructions that is needed by this hardwares to perform there functions
  2. Operating System is the main software which the computer, its hardware and its user needs to interact with the computer. We have different types of Operating System e.g Windows(which is proprietary{research on proprietary software}), Ubuntu(Open Source) 
  3. Then we have programming languages that is responsible for writing the instructions that this computers uses to perform the functions they are the meant to perform and an example of this programming language is Java others are Python, JavaScript
  4. The most popular first program of every programmer is the Hello World program and we are going to do just that 
 ```
         Public class Hello
           {
           public static void main(String[] args)
            {
              //This is a one line comment
              /*And here comes the
                    the multiline comment*/
              /*And here we have the JavaDoc 
                    comment which is also multiline**/
              System.out.println("Hello World");
             }
           }
```
