Note: Anything you learn stays better when you use to make or do something

1. (Test Drive: Carbon Footprint Calculator) Some scientists believe that carbon emissions,
especially from the burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to global warming and that this
canbecombattedifindividualstakestepstolimittheiruseofcarbon-basedfuels.Organizationsand
individuals are increasingly concerned about their “carbon footprints.” Websites such as TerraPass

and Carbon Footprint

2. (Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see
that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the
American Heart Association (AHA) (www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736),
the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in
years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the
health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.] Create a class called HeartRates. The
class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide set and get methods. The class also should
include a method that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and
returns the person’s maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person’s target
heart rate. Write a Java application that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object
of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name,
last name and date of birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart
rate and target-heart-rate range.


3. (Tic-Tac-Toe) Create a class TicTacToe that will enable you to write a program to play TicTac-Toe. The class contains a private 3-by-3 two-dimensional array. Use an enumeration to represent the value in each cell of the array. The enumeration’s constants should be named X, O and EMPTY
(for a position that does not contain an X or an O). The constructor should initialize the board elements to EMPTY. Allow two human players. Wherever the first player moves, place an X in the specified square, and place an O wherever the second player moves. Each move must be to an empty
square. After each move, determine whether the game has been won and whether it’s a draw. If you
feel ambitious, modify your program so that the computer makes the moves for one of the players.
Also, allow the player to specify whether he or she wants to go first or second. If you feel exceptionally ambitious, develop a program that will play three-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe on a 4-by-4-by-4
board [Note: This is an extremely challenging project!]

4. (“The Twelve Days of Christmas” Song) Write an application that uses repetition and
switch statements to print the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” One switch statement should
be used to print the day (“first,” “second,” and so on). A separate switch statement should be used
to print the remainder of each verse. Visit the website en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_
of_Christmas_(song) for the lyrics of the song


5. (CarbonFootprint Interface: Polymorphism) Using interfaces, as you learned in this chapter, you can specify similar behaviors for possibly disparate classes. Governments and companies
worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned with carbon footprints (annual releases of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere) from buildings burning various types of fuels for heat, vehicles burning
fuels for power, and the like. Many scientists blame these greenhouse gases for the phenomenon
called global warming. Create three small classes unrelated by inheritance—classes Building, Car
and Bicycle. Give each class some unique appropriate attributes and behaviors that it does not have
in common with other classes. Write an interface CarbonFootprint with a getCarbonFootprint
method. Have each of your classes implement that interface, so that its getCarbonFootprint method
calculates an appropriate carbon footprint for that class (check out a few websites that explain how
to calculate carbon footprints). Write an application that creates objects of each of the three classes,
places references to those objects in ArrayList<CarbonFootprint>, then iterates through the ArrayList, polymorphically invoking each object’s getCarbonFootprint method. For each object, print
some identifying information and the object’s carbon footprint

6. Write the card shuffling and simulation program

7. Implement exception handling in any one of the former programs you have written

8. Write an ATM program as shown inside Java How to Program

9. Perfect your code on the above

10. (Printing Dates in Various Formats) Dates are printed in several common formats. Two of
the more common formats are
04/25/1955 and April 25, 1955
Write an application that reads a date in the first format and prints it in the second format

11. (Phishing Scanner) Phishing is a form of identity theft in which, in an e-mail, a sender posing as a trustworthy source attempts to acquire private information, such as your user names, passwords, credit-card numbers and social security number. Phishing e-mails claiming to be from
popular banks, credit-card companies, auction sites, social networks and online payment services
may look quite legitimate. These fraudulent messages often provide links to spoofed (fake) websites
where you’re asked to enter sensitive information.
Visit McAfee® (www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/anti_phishing/phishing_top10.html),
Security Extra (www.securityextra.com/) and other websites to find lists of the top phishing
scams. Also check out the Anti-Phishing Working Group (www.antiphishing.org/), and the FBI’s
Cyber Investigations website (www.fbi.gov/cyberinvest/cyberhome.htm), where you’ll find information about the latest scams and how to protect yourself.
Create a list of 30 words, phrases and company names commonly found in phishing messages.
Assign a point value to each based on your estimate of its likeliness to be in a phishing message
(e.g., one point if it’s somewhat likely, two points if moderately likely, or three points if highly
likely). Write an application that scans a file of text for these terms and phrases. For each occurrence of a keyword or phrase within the text file, add the assigned point value to the total points for
that word or phrase. For each keyword or phrase found, output one line with the word or phrase,
the number of occurrences and the point total. Then show the point total for the entire message.
Does your program assign a high point total to some actual phishing e-mails you’ve received? Does
it assign a high point total to some legitimate e-mails you’ve received?
