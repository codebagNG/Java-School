 This part of the course is to introduce you to the folowing facts
  1. Computers are made up of two major parts(Hardware and Software) Hardware is the physical component, and the software are the programs and set of organised instructions that is needed by this hardwares to perform there functions
  2. Operating System is the main software which the computer, its hardware and its user needs to interact with the computer. We have different types of Operating System e.g Windows(which is proprietary{research on proprietary software}), Ubuntu(Open Source) 
  3. Then we have programming languages that is responsible for writing the instructions that this computers uses to perform the functions they are the meant to perform and an example of this programming language is Java others are Python, JavaScript
  4. The most popular first program of every programmer is the Hello World program and we are going to do just that 
 ```
         public class Hello
           {
           public static void main(String[] args)
            {
              //This is a one line comment
              /*And here comes the
                    the multiline comment*/
              /*And here we have the JavaDoc 
                    comment which is also multiline**/
              
              System.out.println("Hello World");
              /*The above code prints out hello world on the screen take note of the structure, all letters before the parentheses in lower case except the "S" in System and the double inverted commas*/
 
        
             }
           }
```
   5. Java Memory concepts entails garbage collection in java and it is basically the language's way of freeing up resources. You should research more on it because very much it will form the basis of how your program will be efficient
   6. Decision making is one of the core of all programming languages and some operators are peculiar with it. These operators are shown below 
       1. Equality operators are ==(equivalent to equals to) and !=(equivalent to not equals to) 
       2. Relational operators are >(greater than), <(less than), >=(greater than or equals to), <=(less than or equals to). Check the reference material to know more about how relational and equality operators are being used
