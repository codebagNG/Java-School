(Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see
that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the
American Heart Association (AHA) (www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736),
the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in
years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the
health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.] Create a class called HeartRates. The
class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide set and get methods. The class also should
include a method that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and
returns the person’s maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person’s target
heart rate. Write a Java application that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object
of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name,
last name and date of birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart
rate and target-heart-rate range.
